# MSC Geomet Example - Connecting to Authenticated Layers with ArcMap

This example shows how to connect ArcMap to the username/password authenticated Web Map Service (WMS) layers on the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) GeoMet platform.

## Connect to WMS
First, connect to the Geomet data source by selecting Add Data, then if necessary click Up One Level until this level is shown. Double-click 'GIS Servers', then 'Add WMS Server'. We then need supply a geomet path complete with hidden layer name, e.g. https://geo.weather.gc.ca/geomet?LAYERS=DHPS_1km_RiverDischarge and add User and Password credentials at the bottom.
